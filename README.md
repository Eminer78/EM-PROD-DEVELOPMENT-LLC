Cohort 15-A

Overview/description of the Project:

This is a website for an engineering services firm that offers program management, electrical, mechanical, and software engineering services for anyone that may need them.

The home page describes in general what the firm does. The services page describes the services that are offered. The about us page describes who we are and our experience. Lastly there is a form that interested parties can contact the firm.

The site uses HTML, CSS, and there is a bootstrap carousel on the home page.

Things that I would like to enhance on the website are;

1. Add more samples of previous projects on the home page.
2. Add more styling elements to the pages as the site is fairly bland.
3. Potentially add other features that would make the page more interactive by adding videos.
4. Make the site more user friendly on smaller screen devices.
